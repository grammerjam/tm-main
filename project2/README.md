This project is built with HTML and SCSS.
To run this project you'll need to compile the scss into a `/css` directory.

## Instructions for VS Code users

We have it configured to use the plugins [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) and [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Once the plugins are installed, hit the "Watch Sass" button on the bottom status bar followed by the "Go Live" button.

From there go to [localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500) or the location given by Live Server.
